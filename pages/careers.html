        <h1>Come build belonging with us</h1>
        <p>Discord is working toward an inclusive world where no one feels like an outsider, where genuine human
            connection is a click, text chat, or voice call away. A place where everyone can find belonging.
            Challenging? Heck yes. Rewarding? Double heck yes. It's a mission that gives us the chance to positively
            impact millions of people all over the world.</p>
        <p>So if this strikes a chord, and you're equally comfortable communicating in memes and gifs as you are in code
            or decks, come build belonging with us!

            <p>Our people, much like our users, can't be put in a box. The quirky and unique cast of characters that
                work together at Discord may be intrepid travelers from all walks of life, but there's a reason we've
                all ended up here. We care about each other, the work we do, and the future we're building — like, a
                lot. We pull our own weight and treat each other with extreme empathy. <strong>No cogs or jerks
                    allowed.</strong></p>

            <h2>Join a culture that builds belonging.</h2>
            <p>Imagine a workplace where everyone belongs. At Discord, we aren't just imagining this place, we're
                creating it. We're building an inclusive, diverse, and welcoming space that reflects the world we live,
                play, and work in — because we know that with diversity comes better ideas, a better product, a better
                work environment, and ultimately a better company.
