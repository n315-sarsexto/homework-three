## Discord Remake

This is a remake of the website for Discord. No, this isn't a remake of the web app - though, that might be a project I take on at some point. But for now, this is a scaled-down remake of their website. For pages that I didn't include, I've linked to the live version of their website. Discord is an app that I've used for eons, so remaking its site was something I figured would be a good challenge. The main goal of this project is to use internal navigation using the MVC-method, moving site content outside of the javascript files and into individual HTML files.
